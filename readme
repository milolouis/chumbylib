This program is meant to provide an extensive and easy to use library
for the programmable registers on the Chumby Hacker Board.

GPIO functions are used as follows:

 >>> chb = CHB()
 >>> chb.setOut('D5')    # must be set as out before writing
 >>> chb.write('D5',1)   # high
 >>> chb.write('D5',0)   # low


LCD example:
 >>> chb.startLcd()
 >>> for i in range(10):
 ...   chb.lcd.write(0xff)
 >>> time.sleep(2)
 >>> chb.lcd.clear()
 

All pins are labeled as they are on the CHB. 
Only the 2x13 male header is currently supported.
