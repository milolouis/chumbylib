This program is meant to provide an easy to use library for the
programmable registers on the Chumby Hacker Board.

As of yet, only GPIO pins are supported, but ADC support will be
added very soon, with I2C PWM to follow. 

GPIO functions are used as follows:

 >>> chb = CHB()
 >>> chb.setOut('D5')    # must be set as out before writing
 >>> chb.write('D5',1)   # high
 >>> chb.write('D5',0)   # low


LCD example:
 >>> chb.startLcd()
 >>> for i in range(10):
 ...   chb.lcd.write(0xff)
 >>> time.sleep(2)
 >>> chb.lcd.clear()
 

All pins are labeled as they are on the CHB. 

Note- There are a few duplicate pins between the 2x13 and the 
      2x22 headers, namely the ADC pins.
